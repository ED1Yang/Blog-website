FINAL PROJECT-Blog website
by TEAM GREA 

Hello everyone! This project is to build a blogging website.
For the request of this project, please refer to the handout, and for the introduction of this project, please refer to my reflective report.


Notes:

- The project submitted is the same as the one deployed to sporadic, however, the site-key for the reCAPTCHA needs to be different for the two versions as it relies on the URL. 

We have assumed that markers will test our site on localhost, and as such the submitted version's sitekey will work on localhost only. If you wish to redeploy or deploy the project again, line 128 of the registration_form.jsp will need to be modified and the sitekey changed to: 6LfV01wUAAAAABs5ANFS_rd39JbsetwQ5jCqfIC3

- The website has been tested and built exclusively in Chrome, so it is highly recommended it be used.

- Some updates such as changing a profile picture require the cache to be cleared in order to become visible, especially if using Chrome. Please clear cache as frequently as possible.

- To reply to a comment, type the text into the same text box as is used for main commenting, but rather than clicking "Post", click on the light blue arrow under the comment you want to reply to.

- You can click on the 3 category images under "Latest articles" to display the latest article. This will be the proper HTML as the author created. 

- Green open eye means comment is visible, when clicking on this it will become an orange closed eye which means the comment is invisible, and vice versa.

- Upon logging on, clicking on the avatar image in the top left corner will take you to the user profile page, from which the account settings can be accessed.

- If you'd like to go home from the User sign up page, the red Apollo link at the bottom will take you there.

- The administrator cannot delete themselves, as this is non-sensical.
